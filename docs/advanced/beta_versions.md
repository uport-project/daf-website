We are currently in public beta but we want to make sure that the road is smooth as possible for anyone starting to build applications on Veramo with a view to deploying in production. If you are planning on deploying an application in production within the next year please [contact us here](/docs/) and talk with us about your plans.

Versions for beta will follow this pattern.

```
@veramo/core@beta.3
```

Minor feature version. This will have new features or refactorings of previous features.

```
@veramo/core@beta.3.1 - Minor fix version
```

Patch fix version. This will have bug fixes from the previous major version.

### `@beta.1`

18th December 2020
This is our first official public release after 14 months of development, internal alpha and beta battle testing. We have arrived at a relatively stable core api that we can iterate on without too many breaking changes. Core API as is per docs.
