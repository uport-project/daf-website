Veramo is in public beta. There will be some breaking changes in the coming months and we endeavour to communicate these in advance via our blog. However, we expect the core APIs to remain relatively stable. You can keep up to date here and get involved in our growing community. We are excited to see what you build with Veramo!

:::

Veramo is a JavaScript framework that makes it easy for anyone to use cryptographically verifiable data in their applications. It was designed to make it easy for developers who want to use dids, verifiable credentials and other data centric protocols to bring next generation features to their users.

These docs are written for anyone wishing to learn more about the grounding principles behind verifiable data and develop a deeper understanding of the Veramo framework in order to build next generation apps that leverage the many benefits of [trust networks](/docs/).

Looking for ideas? You can [check out how you can easily build](/docs/) systems like uport, brightid, a custodial identity platform, a covid vaccine verification app and many more.

## How to use these docs

If you are new to the concept of verifiable data it would be best to read the fundamentals section linearly as each section builds on knowledge and terminology gained in the previous.

If you are more experienced with verifiable data concepts and or development in general you can dive into the architecture section where more specifics of how the internals work are covered or you could [deploy your own cloud agent](/docs/agent/cloud_agent). You can also jump over to the API reference section. Links and more info about these packages can also be found in the plugins section.

## Mission

> Our mission is to empower developers to build better trust layers in their applications.

We obsess over standards and interop so developers and product owners can focus on building next generation applications that leverage the benefits of decentralized verification.

## Why Veramo?

The verifiable data landscape has grown exponentially in the past few years and continues to grow at an accelerated rate. Where you have accelerated innovation you will also have a lot of competing standards. This anomaly makes interoperability and standards are hard.

> Veramo was designed to be flexible, modular and scalable. It allows developers to orchestrate a custom system from a growing list of standards without worrying about interoperability and fast changing specs.

Competing standards can create uneccessary burden and confusion for product owners and developers who prefer not to be tied to a specific vendor or invest too much building on standards that will most likely change. On top of changing standards there is a complex [dependency tree](/docs/advanced/data_flow) per platform that requires considerable effort to manage.

However, this should not prevent businesses from bringing the immense value of decentralized verification to their users.

> We envision an ecosytem of interoperapble functionality made possible through specialised community plugins that respect open standards.

At Veramo we work closely with the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) and [DIF](https://identity.foundation/) with the intention of building compatibility across a multitude of projects and initiaves in the space.

Using Veramo you can design your did agent how you want it by using the [core plugins](/docs/agent/plugins) or [write your own custom plugins.](/docs/guides/create_plugin) We have plugins for DID Methods, Messaging Protocols, Storage, Key Management, Authentication and many more.
